# Note: All my major repositories have been migrated to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ryanabx). I would encourage everyone else who is able to do so, to do the same.

Hello! I'm Ryan Brue,

I'm a software developer in my day job, and in my free time a hobbyist open source contributor!
My favorite languages are Rust, and Python as a scripting language :)

I'm most known for packaging the COSMIC desktop environment for Fedora, and being the occasional contributor to the COSMIC desktop project.

I contribute to basically any project that interests me. I don't have forked repositories on my main GitHub, [find my forked repositories here](https://github.com/ryanabx-contrib).
